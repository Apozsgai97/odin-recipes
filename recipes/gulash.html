    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The goulash soup is a traditional hungarian recipe, which is perfect for cold nights to feel warmer. In Hungary we traditionally make the soup outside in our garden with a cauldron. Somehow this ritual makes the goulash soup much more better. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter or lard (preferred)</li>

        <li>2 cups beef broth or water</li>
        <li>3 carrots</li>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
