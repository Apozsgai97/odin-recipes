    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Learn how to make langos, a tasty fried Hungarian bread that is best enjoyed warm. To simplify the recipe, instant yeast and a stand mixer is used to make the dough.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (280 grams)</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk (250 ml)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>sour cream or yoghurt</li>
        <li>shredded cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, salt and sugar. Mix with a spoon. Add yeast. Mix again. Add milk and give it a quick mix with a spoon again.</li>
        <li>With bread attachment, mix on low speed for a few minutes (about 3-4) or until well combined (see note 4). </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and clean kitchen towel. Let it proof in a warm place until doubled in size (45-60 minutes, see note 5). </li>
        <li>When ready, transfer the dough onto a well-floured work top. Divide into 4 equally-looking pieces.</li>
        <li>Form a ball out of each piece.</li>
        <li>Roll out with a rolling pin (about ¼-inch/0.5-centimeters thick and about 7-inch/17-centimeter in diameter).</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil.</li>
        <li>When hot, add one rolled flatbread in. Fry for about a minute before turning it over (use kitchen tongs) and fry for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Langos should be nice golden brown, but some pale spots are fine.</li>
        <li>Place each fried bread onto a few sheets of paper kitchen towel to get rid of any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Spread each with a mixture of crushed garlic & olive oil.</li>
        <li>Top with sour cream and shredded cheese.</li>

    </ol>
