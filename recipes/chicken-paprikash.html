    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Chicken paprikash is the epitome of Eastern European comfort food, and a much-beloved dish from my childhood that my mother often prepared. Fantastic served over buttered egg noodles, spaetzle, or tiny gnocchi, my chicken paprikash recipe features juicy chunks of boneless chicken thighs, vegetables, a generous sprinkle of sweet Hungarian paprika, a touch of bay leaf, and a rich, velvety sauce kissed with sour cream! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size chunks</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>3 ribs celery, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press</li>
        <li> large, dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>tablespoons paprika (sweet, not hot)</li>
       <li> Pinch white pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup (level) flour</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups chicken stock or broth</li>
       <li> 2 Roma or campari tomatoes, seeded and diced</li>
       <li> 3 tablespoons sour cream </li>
         <li>Chopped parsley, for garnish</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To get started, gather and prep all of your ingredients according to the ingredient list above to have ready and organized for use.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces into a large bowl, and sprinkle over some salt and pepper. Place a pot or a large, deep Dutch oven or skillet over medium-high heat, and drizzle in the olive oil. Once hot, add the seasoned chicken pieces and sear them for a few moments just until a pale golden brown. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add in the butter, and once melted, add in the onion, carrot and celery, plus a pinch of salt and pepper, and saute to soften things a bit, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add in the garlic, the bay leaves, the paprika, and the white pepper, and stir those in to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Once aromatic, sprinkle in the flour in an even layer, and stir to incorporate it into the veggies, cooking it for about 30 seconds or so </li>
        <li>Next, gently whisk in the chicken stock until well blended and smooth, and bring things to a vigorous simmer. Add back into the pot the chicken, as well as the diced tomatoes, then reduce the heat so that the chicken paprikash is gently bubbling.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid slightly askew, and cook the paprikash for about 30 to 35 minutes, until the veggies and chicken are tender, and the flavors melded.</li>
        <li>To finish the chicken paprikash, remove the bay leaves and gently whisk in the sour cream. Fold in the chopped parsley, and serve with your choice of side such as buttered egg noodles, spaetzle, gnocchi, or mashed potatoes.</li>
